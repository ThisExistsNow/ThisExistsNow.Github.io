            <p>This is actually my 2nd time taking this class, so I already know a thing or two about some of this. Though once we get
                into the database side of things, I'll really have to buckle down, since that's where I went wrong last time. So I'd
                give myself a solid 4/10 on web dev skills. All I'm hoping to get out of this class is to be able to publish my own
                web pages for my own desires, as I will need them for posting my concept art and just holding information about my
                creative projects.

            <p>As this quarantine is stretching on, and I am unemployed I have had the most time on my hands since high school! Because of my
                inevitable boredom I had to figure something out to keep myself occupied, when I realized, I have a lot of hobbies, and I
                usually don't have enough time to cultivate my skill in all of them. Because of the number of hobbies I like and my time
                restrictions, I usually considered myself to be mediocre at a whole bunch of different things, but this quarantine has given
                me enough time to realize that I'm actually better than that after all this time!
