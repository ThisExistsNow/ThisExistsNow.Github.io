            <h1>4/8/2020 Assignment 1</h1>
            <h2>ENTRY 1</h2>
            <p>My main issue with getting this assignment done,
                was getting it started, I'm trying to get myself
                to get started on all my homework faster, but
                so far I haven't done the best job of that, but I
                will improve throughout the remainder of this week!
                Luckily with my time constraint I already knew how
                to get this assignment done, with my most helpful 
                resource being my past assignment, which I used to 
                refresh myself on how to use some of these html tags.
                I'm sure much of my past work will be of assistance here!
